Roadmap:

11/26/17
- Attempt to compare scoreboard data with historical instances (at t-1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- if that works -> spit out point timestamps -> clean up noisy timestamps -> edit.

12/5/17 
- Test with a full challenger match

12/19/17
- Try smooth ball tracking
- if that works -> test on non-challenger matches

12/26/17 
- regardless of smooth ball tracking -> try it out.

12/29/17
- check this: https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/14802/can-i-use-ffmpeg-in-a-commercial-product
- some more docs: https://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html
- video editor...
	- automatic cropping (using the tennis court lines)
	- "easy" editing (cuts, remove clips, etc...)
- then make it an online video editor?
	- look at licensing, or diy
	- like this? https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut
	- or this? https://github.com/casatt/html5-videoEditor

A few "point finding" methods.
How to determine when a point is finished:

1. Use the "amount of motion"
- before serve: the least?
- point ends: 'deceleration'?

2. net cord?
- but players will interfere? 
- model the tennis court?

3. Sound
- Does not work with the presence of a "crowd", because the "clapping" interfered with the sound of the ball-racquet interactions.

4. Ball tracking
a) check for 'smooth path'
- if there is no smooth path for more than 2 seconds, 
... then the point is finished?

	- opencv houghcircles python
	- kalman filter to predict movement
	- trace path?
	- how to judge if a path is 'smooth'?

- background subtraction
	- do a "long exposure" of x frames
		- "add" up white pixels of the last x frames
		- then display the resulting frame
	- then look for a line of x width, with j allowable curve
	https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_houghlines/py_houghlines.html

b) (1/11/18)
1. canny edge detection (there is reduced noise in edge images (Xie et. al))
	(pg.29) https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/SSU/TC-SSU-08302006125935.pdf

2. background subtraction

3. look for moving objects
	- if there is too much movement off court: only focus on court
		- generate a model of the court?
	- two players and the ball
	- unique characteristics of the ball
		- "crosses" the net
		- certain size (in relation to the court dimensions)
		- "circular", or "one blob"
		- moves in a "smooth" fashion
